# Face-and-Eye-Detection
Face and Eye Detection using Haar Cascade Algorithm
Haar Cascade is an object detection algorithm used to identify facial features in an image or a real time video. It uses edge or line detection features. The model is trained with multiple images containing faces and no faces. It is then stored in XML files and can be used using open CV methods.
